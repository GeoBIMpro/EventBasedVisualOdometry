* Clean up existing MATLAB code
     * figure out better way to do DiscretizeKeyframe
     * keep in mind c++ implementation - will be easier if they're similar structure
* Read "Real-time plane-sweeping stereo with multiple sweeping directions"

* Implement tracking in MATLAB
* Implement in C++ as ROS node
     * replace matlab cv functions with opencv?
     * separate algorithm and node if possible
* make parfor an option with global
* add license
